# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is WitnessChain?
WitnessChain is a decentralized platform that preserves and verifies human rights documentation using Filecoin, IPFS, and blockchain technology. It provides immutable, censorship-resistant storage for evidence including videos, photos, and voice recordings.

### Why is WitnessChain needed?
In politically unstable regions and conflict zones, critical evidence of human rights violations is frequently deleted, manipulated, or suppressed. Traditional centralized storage systems are vulnerable to censorship and tampering. WitnessChain provides a decentralized solution that can't be censored or manipulated.

### How does WitnessChain work?
1. Users upload evidence (encrypted) to the IPFS network
2. Content is timestamped on Filecoin blockchain
3. Human validators verify the authenticity of content
4. Verified content is stored permanently on Filecoin
5. Authorized parties can access verified evidence

### Is WitnessChain free to use?
Yes, WitnessChain is open-source and free to use. However, there may be costs associated with Filecoin storage deals and network fees, which are minimal compared to traditional storage solutions.

## Technical Questions

### What technologies does WitnessChain use?
- **Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)** - Smart contracts and timestamps
- **IPFS** - Distributed content storage
- **Drand** - Decentralized randomness
- **DIDs** - Decentralized identity
- **libp2p** - Peer-to-peer networking
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Privacy preservation

### How is data stored?
Data is stored in a multi-layer approach:
1. **IPFS** - Distributed storage across multiple nodes
2. **Filecoin** - Long-term storage deals with storage providers
3. **Blockchain** - Immutable timestamps and verification records
4. **Encryption** - All data is encrypted before storage

### Is my data private?
Yes, WitnessChain implements multiple privacy measures:
- **End-to-end encryption** - Data is encrypted before upload
- **Decentralized identity** - Pseudonymous identity without personal data
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Verify without revealing information
- **User-controlled access** - You control who can access your data

### How is content verified?
Content verification uses a multi-layer approach:
1. **AI Analysis** - Optional automated content analysis
2. **Human Validators** - Network of human validators verify content
3. **Multi-signature** - Multiple validators must approve content
4. **Reputation System** - Validators are rated based on performance

## Security Questions

### Is WitnessChain secure?
WitnessChain implements multiple security measures:
- **Cryptographic proofs** - Immutable proof of content authenticity

- **Encryption** - All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access control** - Granular permissions and authorization
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive logging of all activities

### Can my identity be exposed?
WitnessChain uses decentralized identity (DIDs) to protect your privacy:
- **Pseudonymous identity** - No personal information required
- **Identity rotation** - You can change your identity anytime
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Verify without revealing identity
- **Selective disclosure** - Control what information you share

### What if validators are compromised?
The system has multiple safeguards:
- **Reputation system** - Validators are rated based on performance
- **Staking mechanisms** - Validators stake tokens that can be slashed
